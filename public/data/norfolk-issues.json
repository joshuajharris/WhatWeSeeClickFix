Several old pothole patches have worked their way loose or disintegrated leaving uneven and bumpy and pothole filled sections of the lane leading to the I-64 W on-ramp for the interstate off Northampton Blvd clustered more on the right side of the far right lane hitting the center and passenger side of the vehicle. \n\nThis is still ON Northampton Blvd but is approaching the interstate on ramp for I-64 West. This lane is in serious need of repair and smoothing. Too many uneven patches in one spot for several dozen feet make for rough driving when approaching the exit at any time of day and at any speed.\n\nThis issue continues onto the ramp also.","rating":3,"lat":36.876382928331,"lng":-76.1951404321539,"address":"6280 Northampton Boulevard Norfolk, Virginia","closed_at":"2015-02-20T12:09:09-05:00","acknowledged_at":null,"created_at":"2014-12-03T13:21:27-05:00","updated_at":"2015-02-23T15:25:04-05:00","shortened_url":"http://bit.ly/1pUxDDw","media":{"video_url":null,"image_full":null,"image_square_100x100":null,"representative_image_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/files/comment_images/0005/2097/Northampton_Blvd_I-64_W_Ramp_Entrance_far_Right_Lane_square.jpg"},"point":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-76.1951404321539,36.876382928331]},"url":"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1386612","html_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/issues/1386612","comment_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1386612/comments","flag_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1386612/flag","transitions":{"close_url":"https://seeclickfix.com/api/v2/issues/1386612/close"},"reporter":{"id":801661,"name":"Alison M","witty_title":"Municipal Avenger","role":"Registered User","civic_points":865,"avatar":{"full":"https://crm.seeclickfix.com/files/user_images/0002/6000/1926653_10101581590636559_394380614_n.jpg","square_100x100":"https://crm.seeclickfix.com/files/user_images/0002/6000/1926653_10101581590636559_394380614_n_square.jpg"}}}
